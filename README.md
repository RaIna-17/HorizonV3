# HorizonV3
Fixed a script list bug Renamed "Form1.cs" (basically the main Neoblox file) to "Neoblox.cs" The multi API selection drop down looks more modern The "Kill Roblox Process" button now shows an error if Roblox isn't open Buttons and checkboxes will now use the "Hand" cursor instead of the default one
